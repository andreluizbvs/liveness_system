def identify_vulnerabilities(model, detailed_test_dataset):
    """
    Identify which types of adversarial attacks the model is most vulnerable.

    Args:
    - model: The model to be evaluated.
    - detailed_test_dataset: The dataset to be used for the evaluation. It should contain labels for the type of adversarial attack (e.g., ) for each spoof image.

    Returns:
    - vulnerabilities: A list of the types of attacks that the model is most vulnerable. Anything with an accuracy below X% should be considered a vulnerability.
    (X should be defined together with the Product/Project Owner)

    """
    # Here we could evaluate the model to identify which type of attack has a higher failure rate (silicone mask, printed photo, screen replay, etc).
    # For that, type-of-attack annotations data should be provided (or annotated)

    # src/models/adversarial_attack.py is actually an attempt to anticipate this, without needing to know the main vulnerabilities of the model.
    # It will try to generate various types of attacks, but anything very customized for the to-be-improved model.
